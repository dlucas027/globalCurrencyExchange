# globalCurrencyExchange

 **Convert your currency from anywhere in the world**  

A project focused on learning and using APIs, exploring Python libraries, and integrating a graphical interface with the help of CustomTKinter.

## üåêThe currency converter uses a free API to fetch exchange rates, updating every minute.
In addition to converting currencies from around the world, it also allows you to check the exchange rates of some blockchain-based currencies, such as Bitcoin.

## Technologies used
- **Python**
- **Awesome API**

## Learning from the project
In this project I was able to understand a little more about the consumption of APIs, how to handle an XML file and deal better with dictionaries.
I understood how to integrate buttons and functionalities using CustomTKinter, I was able to better visualize how the functions work and optimize the code.
